        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>
          Programming web applications with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL (or MongoDB), mobile-first CSS and JavaScript.
          We host them either on EC2 or Heroku. We are pretty good with this stuff and we are doing it with passion and honesty.

        <h3>Products</h3>
        <p>
          Although entrepreneurs at heart, we are still far from being full-time on our own products.
          We are trying though and there is at least one app that we are proud of. That is Vetrian, a management suite for veterinarians.
